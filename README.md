# rockPaperScissors
This is my first project under the odin project's javascript foundation course. In this project, I created the rock-paper-scissors game to be played entirely in the console. It is a 5-round game between a user and the computer and at the end of each round, the console outputs the human and the computer choices. It also declares the winner and the accumulated points at each round and output the overall winner at the end of the 5th round.

Some of the JavaScript skills I demonstrated in this project includes:
1. Basic programming concepts like variables, loops and functions.
2. Testing and debugging.
