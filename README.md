# rockPaperScissors
This is my first project under the odin project's javascript foundation course. 

It is a 5-round game between a user and the computer and at the end of each round, the console outputs the human and the computer choices. It also declares the winner and the accumulated points at each round and output the overall winner at the end of the 5th round.

I initially created the rock-paper-scissors game to be played entirely in the console. I then changed the game to be user-friendly by assigning buttons to rock, paper and scissors. In this way, the user can select his/her choice for a round by simply clicking on it. 


Some of the JavaScript skills I demonstrated in this project includes:
1. Basic programming concepts like variables declaration and assignment, loops and functions.
2. Testing and debugging.
3. DOM manipulation and events.
